0.5.0 (2017-03-12)
==================
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes one minor breaking
change, bug fixes and several new features including support for text encodings
other than UTF-8.

A notable accomplishment with respect to Rust is that ripgrep proper now only
contains a single `unsafe` use (for accessing the contents of a memory map).

The **breaking change** is:

* [FEATURE #380](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380):
  Line numbers are now hidden by default when ripgrep is printing to a tty
  **and** the only thing searched is stdin.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Ceylon, CSS, Elixir, HTML, log,
  SASS, SVG, Twig
* [FEATURE #1](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1):
  Add support for additional text encodings, including automatic detection for
  UTF-16 via BOM sniffing. Explicit text encoding support with the
  `-E/--encoding` flag was also added for latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP
  and Shift_JIS, among others. The full list can be found here:
  https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get
* [FEATURE #129](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/129):
  Add a new `-M/--max-columns` flag that omits lines longer than the given
  number of bytes. (Disabled by default!)
* [FEATURE #369](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/369):
  A new flag, `--max-filesize`, was added for limiting searches to files with
  a maximum file size.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #52](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/52),
  [BUG #311](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/311):
  Tweak how binary files are detected and handled. (We are slightly less
  conservative and will no longer use memory without bound.)
* [BUG #326](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326):
  When --files flag is given, we should never attempt to parse positional
  arguments as regexes.
* [BUG #327](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/327):
  Permit the --heading flag to override the --no-heading flag.
* [BUG #340](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/340):
  Clarify that the `-u/--unrestricted` flags are aliases.
* [BUG #343](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/343):
  Global git ignore config should use `$HOME/.config/git/ignore` and not
  `$HOME/git/ignore`.
* [BUG #345](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/345):
  Clarify docs for `-g/--glob` flag.
* [BUG #381](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/381):
  Add license files to each sub-crate.
* [BUG #383](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/383):
  Use latest version of clap (for argv parsing).
* [BUG #392](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/391):
  Fix translation of set globs (e.g., `{foo,bar,quux}`) to regexes.
* [BUG #401](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/401):
  Add PowerShell completion file to Windows release.
* [BUG #405](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/405):
  Fix bug when excluding absolute paths with the `-g/--glob` flag.


0.4.0
=====
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes a couple very
minor breaking changes, a few new features and lots of bug fixes.

This version of ripgrep upgrades its `regex` dependency from `0.1` to `0.2`,
which includes a few minor syntax changes:

* POSIX character classes now require double bracketing. Previously, the regex
  `[:upper:]` would parse as the `upper` POSIX character class. Now it parses
  as the character class containing the characters `:upper:`. The fix to this
  change is to use `[[:upper:]]` instead. Note that variants like
  `[[:upper:][:blank:]]` continue to work.
* The character `[` must always be escaped inside a character class.
* The characters `&`, `-` and `~` must be escaped if any one of them are
  repeated consecutively. For example, `[&]`, `[\&]`, `[\&\&]`, `[&-&]` are all
  equivalent while `[&&]` is illegal. (The motivation for this and the prior
  change is to provide a backwards compatible path for adding character class
  set notation.)

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Crystal, Kotlin, Perl, PowerShell,
  Ruby, Swig
* [FEATURE #83](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/83):
  Type definitions can now include other type definitions.
* [FEATURE #243](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243):
  **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `--column` flag now implies `--line-number`.
* [FEATURE #263](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/263):
  Add a new `--sort-files` flag.
* [FEATURE #275](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/275):
  Add a new `--path-separator` flag. Useful in cygwin.

=====
Bug fixes:

* [BUG #242](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/242):
  ripgrep didn't respect `--colors foo:none` correctly. Now it does.


0.3.0
=====
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes two breaking
changes with lots of bug fixes and some new features and performance
improvements. Notably, if you had a problem with colors or piping on Windows
before, then that should now be fixed in this release.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* ripgrep now requires Rust 1.11 to compile. Previously, it could build on
  Rust 1.9. The cause of this was the move from
  [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)
  for argument parsing.
* The `-e/--regexp` flag can no longer accept a pattern starting with a `-`.
  There are two work-arounds: `rg -- -foo` and `rg [-]foo` or `rg -e [-]foo`
  will all search for the same `-foo` pattern. The cause of this was the move
  from [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)
  for argument parsing.
  [This may get fixed in the
  future.](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/742).

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #33](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/33):
  ripgrep now performs similar to GNU grep on small corpora.
* [PERF #136](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/136):
  ripgrep no longer slows down because of argument parsing when given a large
  argument list.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Elixir.
* [FEATURE #7](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/7):
  Add a `-f/--file` flag that causes ripgrep to read patterns from a file.
* [FEATURE #51](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/51):
  Add a `--colors` flag that enables one to customize the colors used in
  ripgrep's output.
* [FEATURE #138](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/138):
  Add a `--files-without-match` flag that shows only file paths that contain
  zero matches.
* [FEATURE #230](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/230):
  Add completion files to the release (Bash, Fish and PowerShell).

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #37](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/37):
  Use correct ANSI escape sequences when `TERM=screen.linux`.
* [BUG #94](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/94):
  ripgrep now detects stdin on Windows automatically.
* [BUG #117](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/117):
  Colors should now work correctly and automatically inside mintty.
* [BUG #182](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182):
  Colors should now work within Emacs. In particular, `--color=always` will
  emit colors regardless of the current environment.
* [BUG #189](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/189):
  Show less content when running `rg -h`. The full help content can be
  accessed with `rg --help`.
* [BUG #210](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/210):
  Support non-UTF-8 file names on Unix platforms.
* [BUG #231](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/231):
  Switch from block buffering to line buffering.
* [BUG #241](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/241):
  Some error messages weren't suppressed when `--no-messages` was used.


0.2.9
=====
Bug fixes:

* [BUG #226](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/226):
  File paths explicitly given on the command line weren't searched in parallel.
  (This was a regression in `0.2.7`.)
* [BUG #228](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/228):
  If a directory was given to `--ignore-file`, ripgrep's memory usage would
  grow without bound.


0.2.8
=====
Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug with the SIMD/AVX features for using bytecount in commit
  `4ca15a`.


0.2.7
=====
Performance improvements:

* [PERF #223](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/223):
  Added a parallel recursive directory iterator. This results in major
  performance improvements on large repositories.
* [PERF #11](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/11):
  ripgrep now uses the `bytecount` library for counting new lines. In some
  cases, ripgrep runs twice as fast. Use
  `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release --features 'simd-accel avx-accel'`
  to get the fastest possible binary.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Agda, Tex, Taskpaper, Markdown,
  asciidoc, textile, rdoc, org, creole, wiki, pod, C#, PDF, C, C++.
* [FEATURE #149](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/149):
  Add a new `--no-messages` flag that suppresses error messages.
  Note that `rg foo 2> /dev/null` also works.
* [FEATURE #159](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/159):
  Add a new `-m/--max-count` flag that limits the total number of matches
  printed for each file searched.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #199](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/199):
  Fixed a bug where `-S/--smart-case` wasn't being applied correctly to
  literal optimizations.
* [BUG #203](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/203):
  Mention the full name, ripgrep, in more places. It now appears in
  the output of `--help` and `--version`. The repository URL is now also
  in the output of `--help` and the man page.
* [BUG #215](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/215):
  Include small note about how to search for a pattern that starts with a `-`.

  crate that encapsulates all of ripgrep's gitignore matching logic.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #44](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/44):
  ripgrep runs slowly when given lots of positional arguments that are
  directories.
* [BUG #119](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/119):
  ripgrep didn't reset terminal colors if it was interrupted by `^C`.
